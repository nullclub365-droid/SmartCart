    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>SmartCart</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("the App").</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>SmartCart ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("the App").</p>
    
    <h2>2. Data Storage - Local Only</h2>
    <p>SmartCart is designed as an offline-first application. All data you enter into the App, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recipes and meal plans</li>
        <li>Grocery lists and pantry items</li>
        <li>Nutrition tracking data</li>
        <li>User preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Cooking history and notes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>is stored exclusively on your device. We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any of your personal data on external servers or cloud services.</p>
    
    <h2>3. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect personal information</li>
        <li>Track your usage or behavior</li>
        <li>Share data with third parties</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Send data to external servers</li>
        <li>Access your contacts, photos, or other personal data without your explicit action</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All functionality operates entirely on your device using local storage.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request certain permissions on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To remind you about meal prep, expiry dates, or scheduled meals (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and export your data for backup purposes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are optional and only used when you explicitly enable the related features. You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Backup</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the backup and restore feature, your data export file is created and stored on your device or a location you choose. We do not have access to these backup files. You are responsible for securing and managing your backup files.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may display advertisements through third-party ad networks (Google AdMob). These services may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies. However, the App itself does not share your personal data with these services.</p>
    <p>If you use the premium version or make in-app purchases, payment processing is handled by your device's app store (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using device lock screens and biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
        <li>Regularly backing up your data using the App's backup feature</li>
        <li>Being cautious when sharing your device with others</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored on your device, you can delete your data at any time by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uninstalling the App (which removes all local data)</li>
        <li>Using the App's data deletion features in settings</li>
        <li>Manually clearing the App's data through your device settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once deleted, data cannot be recovered unless you have a backup.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data because it's stored on your device. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View all data stored in the App</li>
        <li>Modify or delete any data at any time</li>
        <li>Export your data for backup purposes</li>
        <li>Stop using the App and delete all data by uninstalling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since we don't collect or store your data externally, there's no data to request, modify, or delete from our servers.</p>
    
    <h2>11. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this document. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    
    <h2>12. International Users</h2>
    <p>The App may be used by users worldwide. Since all data is stored locally on your device, no data is transferred across international borders. Your data remains subject to the privacy laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
    
    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us through the App's support channels or settings menu.</p>
